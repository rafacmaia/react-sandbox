Thoughts:
Really appreciated reading it even if there's a lot that hasn't aged quite
well. Their is a feeling of epicness in following this (toxic) friendship over
4 decades. And something about reading the language and the queer references
that feels so special, like a treasured time capsule. It's a very special book
in a way and yes, iffy at times, but very deserving of a spot in the canon of
queer literature.
