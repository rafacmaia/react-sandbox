      "Really appreciated reading it even if there's a lot that hasn't aged well. There's a feeling of epicness in following this (toxic) friendship over 4 decades, and something about the language and the queer references feels so special, like a treasured time capsule. It's a very special book in a way, iffy at times, but deserving of a spot in the canon of queer lit.",

It's thrilling, and thorough, and yes a bit dated (homophobic) in it's villains, but still such an incredibly fleshed out, gripping universe. Then the second was awful, and now this – it rekindles some of the original thrill, I liked it overall, but it's mainly fine. I really don't like his voice, his \"I know everything\" tone, it's so navel-gazey. But I still got into it, invested enough now to see where it goes from here...",

      "Great story, beautifully told. I just really enjoyed reading this, the story was interesting, unique, and I loved the hint of magical realism. There is so much heart behind this, as if a lot of the passion comes just from the will to make space in the literary landscape for these kinds of characters, and it succeeds beautifully. Still thought it was cheap that they killed off Jep, it was textbook 'must kill the sweet one' level of emotional manipulation, but that's a tiny gripe in what is, without a doubt, a great book.",

      "Beautiful writing, beautiful life. Was aware of Audre Lorde, but had never read her before. I felt so privileged to be taken into her life in this way, she writes so beautifully as she pieces together the parts of herself that made her, as she revisits her own journey. This is a kind of life that we don't hear much of and it felt so powerful just to read it, to hear her claim her place in the world, in the landscape of narratives that we associate with America, New York, mid-20th century... Very glad I read this, highly recommend it, and look forward to being welcomed again into her mind and heart.",
